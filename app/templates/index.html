            <h1>Analyzing Crime Trends and Safety Across U.S. Cities (1975-2015)</h1>
            <br>

            <h3><strong>Project Description:</strong></h3><br>
            Our team conducted an in-depth analysis of crime data across major U.S. cities from 1975 to 2015, utilizing data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program to uncover crime trends and their impact on urban communities. By examining these trends, we identify areas where crime rates have improved and those where challenges persist. Our goal is to provide actionable insights that can help families, policymakers, and urban planners make informed decisions about safety and urban development. This project explores both the rise and fall of crime rates, highlights regional variations, and sheds light on the safest and most dangerous places to live in the U.S.            </section>
